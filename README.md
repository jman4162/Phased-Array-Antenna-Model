# Phased Array Antennas: Computing Radiation Patterns Using Python

Welcome to the tutorial on computing and visualizing the radiation patterns of phased array antennas using Python. This guide is designed to help both beginners and advanced users understand the fundamental principles of phased array antennas and how to simulate their behavior through practical Python applications.

## Overview

Phased array antennas are a critical component in modern communication and radar systems, allowing for dynamic beam steering without physical movement of the antenna. This tutorial delves into the mathematical foundations and computational techniques required to model and visualize these antennas' radiation patterns using popular Python libraries.
